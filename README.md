## Opening the Virtual Desktop (Desktop Lite)

1. Start or reopen the devcontainer in VS Code.
2. Once the container is running, open the **Ports** panel in VS Code (usually at the bottom or via the Command Palette: `Ports: Focus on Ports View`).
3. Find the port labeled `Virtual Desktop` (usually port 6080).
4. Click the `Open in Browser` button next to that port. This will open the virtual desktop environment in your browser.

## Rebuilding the DevContainer

To rebuild the devcontainer (for example, after changing `devcontainer.json`):

1. Open the Command Palette in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `F1`).
2. Type and select: `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.
3. Wait for the rebuild process to complete.

You can now use the Java development environment with a virtual desktop interface.
